# §7.4 Case 3 kernels: Lemmas 7.9 & 7.10 (nodes X9 / X10)

The two probabilistic estimates that make Case 3 of Proposition 7.8 (deep triangle,
`s > m/log²m`) work, paper pp.50–54, eqs (7.56)–(7.65). Both are statements about the
infinite two-dimensional renewal process `(j',l'), (j',l')+v₁, (j',l')+v_{[1,2]}, …`
with `v_i` iid copies of `Hold`.

## Lemma 7.10 (X10) — large triangles rarely encountered after a lengthy crossing

Pinned here: `triangle_encounter_le`, paper (7.60). Its event `E_{p,s'}` — that the
renewal endpoint `(j,l)+v_{[1,k+p]}` lands in a triangle of size `≥ s'` — depends only
on the **marginal law** of that single endpoint, so NO stopping-time path-space is
needed (D1). That marginal is `fpDist s` (the first-passage endpoint at budget
`s = l_Δ − l`, `Unroll.lean` / X6) convolved with `iidSum hold p` (the `p` further
`Hold` steps): the def `fpDistPlus` below.

Route (7.60)–(7.65): with `s' ≥ CA²(1+p)` (else trivial), the escape event `E′`
(7.61) — endpoint too high, or `j`-coordinate off the `s/4` centre by `≥ 2s^{0.6}` —
is killed by Lemma 7.7 (`fpDist_location_bound`, X6) + Lemma 2.2 (S3). Outside `E′`,
(7.63)–(7.65) show every size-`≥ s'` triangle the endpoint could hit has apex within
`O(A²(1+p))` of the `≫ s'`-separated lattice `Σ = {(j_Δ', l_Δ)}`; summing the X6
Gaussian envelope `s^{-1/2}G_{1+s}(c(j'−j−s/4))` over that separated set (via the
`sum_range_exp_neg_sq_le` engine) gives `≪ A²(1+p)/s'`. All inputs are theorems.

## Lemma 7.9 (X9) — many triangles usually implies many white points

Paper (7.57): `E exp(−Σ_{p=1}^{t_{min(r,R)}} 1_W((j',l')+v_{[1,p]}) + ε·min(r,R)) ≤
exp(ε)`. This is a functional of the WHOLE walk (the stopping times `t_i` couple all
`v_i`), so — unlike 7.10 — it needs a recursion object, not a marginal. Design in
`PENDING_WORK.md` (lap 51): a budget recursion on `R` over a moving-barrier
first-passage kernel, closed by `fpDist_white_exit` (7.51). Deferred to next lap; the
prerequisite (pairwise triangle disjointness on lattice points, from `F.separated`) is
stated there. NOT pinned here to avoid an unfaithful statement (copy-not-compose).

/-- **The `(k+p)`-step renewal endpoint law** (paper `v_{[1,k+p]}` of Lemma 7.10):
the first-passage endpoint at budget `s` (the `k` steps, `fpDist s`) followed by `p`
further independent `Hold` steps (`iidSum hold p`). By independence its law is the
convolution. This is the exact marginal whose triangle-hitting probability is
Lemma 7.10's `E_{p,s'}`. -/

/-- **Lemma 7.10 — large triangles are rarely encountered shortly after a lengthy
crossing** (paper (7.60), pp.51–54). Starting the renewal walk at a point `(j,l)` of
a black triangle `Δ = t₀` with budget `s = l_Δ − l` obeying `s > m/log²m`
(`m = ⌊n/2⌋ − j`), the endpoint `(j,l) + v_{[1,k+p]}` (law `fpDistPlus s p`) lands in
some triangle of size `≥ s'` — the event `E_{p,s'}` — with probability

  `≪ A²·(1+p)/s' + exp(−c·A²·(1+p))`,

for all `1 ≤ s' ≤ m^{0.4}`, constants uniform in `n, ξ`. The `A²(1+p)/s'` term is the
`≫ s'`-separated Σ-count (7.65); the `exp(−cA²(1+p))` term is the escape event `E′`
(7.61) killed by X6 + S3.
