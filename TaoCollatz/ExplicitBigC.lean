# The assembled explicit big-C theorem (Ruling II successor campaign)

Additive top layer per `BIG_C_EXPLICIT_BOUND_PLAN.md`: exhibit a CLOSED Lean term for the
development's multiplicative constant and prove the quantitative theorem at it, making NO
smallness claim.  `X_spine` is the fully assembled cutoff of the as-written proof route
(the X-chase closure of `tao_collatz_quantitative_spine_atCX`); the constant
`C_tao_assembled` is a tower — enormous, honest, and explicit in the precise sense of the
plan's explicitness contract (closed def bodies; no `Exists.choose`, no existential
interface on the final proof path).

a pure passthrough of the C6a sum-form cutoff parameter. -/
noncomputable def X_spine : ℝ := X_syrSum

/-- Fixed-constant version of `tao_collatz_quantitative_spine_of_le`: weakening the
explicit spine to any positive exponent `c₀ ≤ c_ladder` with the constant held at the
closed `C_spine X_spine` (X-chase).  The bound is monotone in the exponent for
`log N₀ > 1` (i.e. `N₀ ≥ 3`), and the window `N₀ = 2` is absorbed by the second `max` arm
so the bound is `≤ 0 ≤ logProb`.  Body verbatim from the ∃-form, with the obtained `C`
replaced by `C_spine X_spine` via `tao_collatz_quantitative_spine_atCX`. -/
