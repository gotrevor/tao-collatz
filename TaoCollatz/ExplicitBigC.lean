# The assembled explicit big-C theorem (Ruling II successor campaign)

Additive top layer per `BIG_C_EXPLICIT_BOUND_PLAN.md`: exhibit a CLOSED Lean term for the
development's multiplicative constant and prove the quantitative theorem at it, making NO
smallness claim.  `X_spine` is the fully assembled cutoff of the as-written proof route
(the X-chase closure of `tao_collatz_quantitative_spine_atCX`); the constant
`C_tao_assembled` is a tower — enormous, honest, and explicit in the precise sense of the
plan's explicitness contract (closed def bodies; no `Exists.choose`, no existential
interface on the final proof path).

/-- Fixed-constant version of `tao_collatz_quantitative_spine_of_le`: weakening the
explicit spine to any positive exponent `c₀ ≤ c_ladder` with the constant held at the
closed `C_spine X_spine` (X-chase).  The bound is monotone in the exponent for
`log N₀ > 1` (i.e. `N₀ ≥ 3`), and the window `N₀ = 2` is absorbed by the second `max` arm
so the bound is `≤ 0 ≤ logProb`.  Body verbatim from the ∃-form, with the obtained `C`
replaced by `C_spine X_spine` via `tao_collatz_quantitative_spine_atCX`. -/

/-- A closed multiplicative constant for the explicit-exponent theorem
(big-C campaign, Ruling II).  The second arm is exactly the `N₀ = 2` cost of weakening
`c_ladder` to `cTao` (see `tao_collatz_quantitative_spine_atCX_of_le`).  This term is a
TOWER — enormous and useless as a number, by design: the deliverable is explicitness
(closed def bodies all the way down), never smallness. -/

/-- **Theorem 3.1, assembled fully-explicit form** (Ruling II successor deliverable):
Theorem 3.1 holds with BOTH slots closed — the concrete exponent `cTao` and the concrete
(tower-valued) constant `C_tao_assembled`.  No existential exponent, constant, or cutoff
remains on the proof path; the cutoff `X_spine` is absorbed into the constant.  This is
additive: it re-pins nothing and makes no smallness claim about `C_tao_assembled`. -/
