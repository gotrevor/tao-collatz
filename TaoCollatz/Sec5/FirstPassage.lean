# §5 first-passage machinery (nodes C7/C8 defs)

Paper anchors: Tao 2019 §1.3, §5, (1.18), Proposition 1.11.

Definitions for the first passage of the Syracuse orbit below `x`: `passes`,
`passTime`, `passLoc` (paper `Pass_x`, with the `Syr^∞ := 1` convention), the
log-uniform window `logUnifOdd`, and the constant `alpha` (1.18). The stabilization
proposition (Prop 1.11 — the spine's key input) carries `sorry`.

-- `stabilization` below, which is where this content had been absorbed. Judge against p.20.
/-- **Paper (1.19)** — first-passage non-escape: a log-uniformly chosen odd `N_y` in the window
`[y, y^α]` fails ever to descend to `≤ x` with probability `≪ x^{-c}`.

This is node **C7**. It is stated here as its own theorem because Tao proves it separately
(§5 pp.20–21) and **C8's proof consumes it** — it had previously existed *only* as the first
conjunct of `stabilization`, i.e. absorbed into a downstream node's statement, which is precisely
how a blueprint node ends up owing a proof while naming no theorem of its own.
`stabilization` is WATCHED and is NOT touched; this sits beside it (always allowed).

**Route** (Tao pp.20–21). Every step but the first runs over already-proved machinery:
1. ⚠️ **The integral test** — `dTV(N_y mod 2^{n'}, unifOddMod n') ≪ 2^{-n'}` for the log-uniform
   window. **Not in Lean yet.** It is exactly the hypothesis Prop 1.9 (`valuation_dist`) takes,
   and it is the ONLY new analytic brick in this node. Tao: "a routine application of the
   integral test" (with plenty of room to spare).
2. Prop 1.9 (C5 ✅ axiom-clean) ⟹ `dTV(valVec N n₀, geomHalf.iid n₀) ≪ 2^{-c·n₀}`   — (5.4).
3. Lemma 2.2 (S3 ✅ axiom-clean; `geomHalf_tail_bound` is TWO-SIDED, so it covers this LOWER
   tail) ⟹ `P(|ā^{(n₀)}(N_y)| ≤ 1.9·n₀) ≪ 2^{-c·n₀} ≪ x^{-c}`   — (5.5).
4. Descent arithmetic: if `|ā^{(n₀)}| > 1.9·n₀` then by (1.5)/(1.7)
   `Syr^{n₀}(N_y) ≤ 3^{n₀}·2^{-1.9n₀}·x^{α³} + O(3^{n₀}) = O(x^{0.99}) ≤ x`, hence
   `T_x(N_y) ≤ n₀ < ∞`. Here `n₀ := ⌊log x / (10·log 2)⌋` (5.1), so `2^{n₀} ≍ x^{0.1}`.
